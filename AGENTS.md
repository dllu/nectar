This code is divided into two parts: C++ code in `src/main.cpp` which captures image data from an Alkeria camera, and Python code in `python/preview.py` for demosaicing, dewarping, and rendering the resulting image in a corrected RGB image.
The goal is to capture at the maximum, raw quality possible at as high of a data rate as possible.
The Alkeria library is located at `/usr/include/libalkusb3/`.
